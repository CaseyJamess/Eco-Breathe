- Incorporated client-side requests for the Air Quality API, enhancing the application's responsiveness by directly fetching and updating air quality data on the user's device - [OpenWeatherAPI] (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/)


## Features üåü

Global Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard: Access real-time air quality metrics from cities around the world.


## Getting Started üöÄ

Get API Keys:

Before running the application, you'll need to obtain API keys for Mapbox and OpenWeather. Follow these steps:

    Mapbox API Key:
        Visit Mapbox and sign up for an account.
        Create a new access token in your Mapbox account.
        Copy the access token.

    OpenWeather API Key:
        Go to OpenWeatherMap and sign up for an account.
        Obtain your API key from the OpenWeatherMap website.

Configure API Keys:

    Create a .env file in the root of the project.

    Open the .env file and add the following lines:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY = {your_mapbox_api_key}
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPEN_AQ = {your_openweather_api_key}
```

Replace your_mapbox_api_key and your_openweather_api_key with your actual Mapbox and OpenWeather API keys.

Note: Since the .env file is listed in the project's .gitignore, it won't be tracked by version control, ensuring that users can keep their API keys secure.

**Clone the Repository:**

```bash
# Clone the Repository
