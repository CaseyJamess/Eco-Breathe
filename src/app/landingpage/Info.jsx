          Understanding Air Quality with AirActive
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 p">
          <strong>The quality of the air we breathe</strong> profoundly impacts our health and
          well-being. It's influenced by various pollutants, including nitrogen
          dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 p">
          <strong>Recognising the importance of air quality</strong>, AirActive has developed a
          unique color-coded gauge providing a visual representation of air
          quality levels, with each color indicating a specific level. This
          user-friendly approach allows everyone to quickly assess the air's
          condition and take appropriate actions when necessary.
